Hi! I've been working with Computer Vision since 2009, and have done a lot of cool stuff in these years. I started 
on [planar object 3D tracking](/assets/pdf/tcc_gustavo_fuhr.pdf) for AR applications in my undergrad final year project. 
After that, I completed a master's degree in France focusing on [Human Body Pose Estimation](/assets/pdf/report_master_FUHR_Gustavo.pdf). 
Back in Brazil in 2012, I started my PhD at UFRGS in [Pedestrian Tracking and Group Activity Recognition](/assets/pdf/thesis_001020392.pdf).

Around 2015, together with [Guilherme Fickel](https://www.gfickel.com/) (my colleague at UFRGS) and [Renan Franz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renan-franz-4832a71b/), 
we started a company focused on Computer Vision applications, called Meerkat. Our idea was to put to the test all the cool methods that we saw
in papers. Around the same time, deep learning was changing the whole field and we had the opportunity to work in many
different applications/methods. A very short list includes [object detection](https://medium.com/@meerkat.cv/object-detection-and-augmented-reality-the-cup-noodles-band-case-be1567e81c72), [face recognition](https://medium.com/@meerkat.cv/pushing-the-boundaries-of-face-recognition-e34dfdf3b9ad), liveness, ALPR and text
recognition. In 2020, our company was acquired (acqui-hired) by a unicorn startup, [Unico](https://unico.io/). From mid-2020 until 
early-2024, I worked as a senior ML developer in this company, which included training face recognition and face attributes
models in huge datasets.

This website serves as my [résumé](/cv/). It also includes a list of my [publications](/publications/) and [posts](/blog/) on various topics in Computer Vision.
