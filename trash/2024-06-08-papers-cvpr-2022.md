Hello! Last June I attended (in person, yeah!) the CVPR 2022 held in New Orleans, with a bunch of cool people from work. I saw some amazing work, talked to a bunch of great people and I’m still processing how to apply what I saw in the challenges that we see.

In the past few weeks I read a bunch of papers and will try to summarize bellow the most interesting things I saw. The majority of the works here are related to face biometrics, since is what we do most here. :-D

## Face Recognition
Face recognition still is a hot topic, even thought it's becoming increasingly hard to beat the SOTA by a significant amount in the current benchmarks.

I'm always interested in works that scale face recognition to millions of identities. One major problem when training in the scale of millions is that the final fully-connected layer scales linearly with the number of identities, resulting in a huge memory footprint and a slow back-propagation time at each iteration. One method that aims to mitigate this, Partial FC [2], was quite popular even before their publication in CVPR this year — it’s included in the popular [insightface repo](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition). The method tries to approximate the final layer of now standard training face recognition methods (think CosFace, ArcFace, etc.). With the same purpose of better scaling face recognition, Wang et al. (from Alibaba) method [3] improves even further (see below picture) using a substitute for the FC layer named Dynamic Class Pool and a well-designed data loader.
